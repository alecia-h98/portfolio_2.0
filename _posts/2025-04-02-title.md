My most recent projects are included as links below.
The first project I'd like to show showcases some of my talents in React, Zustand, Javascript and Cloudinary.
This link provides a route to a solo project I did in Emerging Digital Academy.
I created a foraging app titled 'Into the Wild' to help novice foragers be able to identify plants in their area while on hikes and without being on a hike.
I am currently still adding to this project as it has become my passion project and I would like to see it used by the masses one day.

As you can see I am just starting out, but plan to create a portfolio website for a skilled photographer in the FM area after my time with EDA.
